3. I am currently working as an electronic engineer, so I think I can say that I have a technical mindset, at the moment I want to learn web development and maybe change my full-time job.

4. I have experience in **pure C** programming and a little experience with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, I like **Gitcracken** as git GUI. Also worked with **Linux** in embedded systems. At the moment I mostly work in **VScode** and **Qt**.

5. I'll just post a solution to a problem from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
[Task:(7 kyu) Friend or Foe](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b42574ff091733d900002f)?
 ```

 function friend(friends){
  
  let outputArr = [];

  friends.forEach(item => {
    if (item.length == 4) { 
      outputArr.push(item) 
    }
  });

  return outputArr;
 }

 ```

6. At work, I used html, css, js to communicate with a web server on an ARM processor, but there were a couple of pages with little functionality.

7. I have a bachelor's degree in electronic equipment development, but I have not taken any courses in Web development, only self-study.

8. English B2 (I often read technical docs and understand fluent English).
